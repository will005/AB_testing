# AB_testing of an E-commerce webiste

The project scenario involved determing whether a particular webpage led to a higher click-thru-rate (CTR) compared to an original page. This project combined wrangling data, feature engineering variables, and bootstrapping to infer the results of an AB test. Bootstrapping was introduced to determine the probability that a particular webpage actually resulted in a higher CTR and whether that result was statistically significant. At the end of the project, we employed a basic logistic regression model for further analysis, and as an introduction to the scikit libraries. 

This project was a part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
