# AB_testing
This project through Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree (term 1) aimed at executing an A/B testing scenario. The customer was an E-commerce website which requested a performance (click-through rate) comparison of two webpages. They wanted to know which webpage would perform better in converting customers. The project involved data wrangling and light feature engineering, basic statistics, employing A/B or hypothesis test and applying a basic logistic regression model.
